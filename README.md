2. Enter your guess (1–100)
3. The computer reveals its number and gives you a hint
4. Keep guessing until you get it right!


**Concepts covered:**
- `while` loop (infinite loop with `break`)
- `Math.random()` for random number generation
- `Scanner` for user input
- Ternary operator for conditional logic
- `if / else if / else` branching
